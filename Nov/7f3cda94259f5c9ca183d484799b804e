A young man identified as Paul Kelechi, narrowly escaped being lynched by angry youths in Akokwa community in Ideato North Local Government in Imo State penultimate Sunday for engaging in homosexual acts with five other boys who had since been handed over to the Police for prosecution.
National Daily gathered that Kelechi who is also wanted by elders of his village in Isi Ekenesi of Okeoha community in Imo State to come appease the deities whom they claimed he had deified by his unacceptable sexual behavior was caught by the angry youths in an hotel around the area.
Speaking with National Daily, one of the angry youth said they became suspicious of the movement of the boys in and out of the hotel at odd hours, especially when they learnt that Kelechi, an unrepentant gay apologist was lodged in the hotel.
He said after one of the suspect was attacked, he confessed to being invited by Kelechi to the hotel for sexual purposes but denied being a gay, as he rejected the offer.
Recall that Paul Kelechi has been in the forefront of gay rights in the country, and was ostracized by his community because of what they termed bizarre sexual preference.
Last year, precisely May 17th, 2006, he was publicly attacked while on weekend picnic with one of his alleged partners. His partner was badly tortured while Paul Kelechi was handed over to the Police, and later released on bail.
Before being declared wanted in his community, Kelechi been attacked and beaten up on several occasions by members of his community and subsequently arrested and tortured by the police because of his sexual preference.
In Nigeria, both religious and political leaders have expressed their distaste for gay people in the country, calling on the National Assembly to enact laws that will punish anybody caught in the act.
